# QuestBot â€“ AI-Powered Text Adventure Game

**QuestBot** is an interactive, text-based adventure game that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to provide a dynamic and adaptive gameplay experience. Players type commands in natural language, and the AI understands, responds, and adapts the story based on the playerâ€™s behavior.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **Supervised Learning (NLP)**
  - Understands player commands (attack, explore, pick, trade, etc.)  
  - Uses trained models to map text input to structured actions  

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clusters players by behavior patterns (e.g., Aggressive, Explorer, Collector)  
  - Adapts gameplay based on player cluster  

- **Reinforcement Learning**
  - Adaptive AI Dungeon Master that evolves the game world  
  - Learns to maximize engagement and challenge based on player actions  

- **Backend + Frontend Integration**
  - Python FastAPI/Flask backend serves ML models and game logic  
  - React frontend for chat-style gameplay interface  

- **Data Persistence**
  - Stores player sessions, progress, and clustering data in a database
